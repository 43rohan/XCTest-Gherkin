# Contributing to XCTest-Gherkin

Thanks for thinking about contributing to XCTest-Gherkin. Here are a few guidelines we'd like you to consider when contributing.

### One issue or bug per Pull Request

Keep your Pull Requests small. Small pull requests are easier to reason about which makes them significantly more likely to get merged.

### Issues before features

If you want to add a feature, please file an [Issue](https://github.com/net-a-porter-mobile/XCTest-Gherkin/issues) first. An Issue gives us the opportunity to discuss the requirements and implications of a feature with you before you start writing code.

### Tests

Please write tests for any new functionality you create. This allows us to verify the behaviour of the new feature and make sure we don't introduce any unwanted regressions.

### Documentation

Please add a description of your change to the CHANGELOG under the `unreleased` header. This allows us to decide what version number should be next when releasing a new version.

If the new feature includes API changes or additions, you should also edit the readme file to reflect these changes.

### Backwards compatibility

Until we reach version 1.0, breaking changes are to be expected, but avoided if possible.  

### Forwards compatibility

Please do not write new code using deprecated APIs.

### Thanks

Thanks again for thinking about contributing to XCTest-Gherkin!
